        content: Investigated the effects of varying the retrained portions of base CNNs, the effects of using different CNN architectures, and the effects of varying the network hyperparameters on the models' performances. With these objectives, 32 model variations were developed and evaluated using various standard metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
